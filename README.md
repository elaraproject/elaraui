# Elara UI

Elara UI is an experimental UI library developed for building modern scientific applications for Project Elara. It is written in Rust and uses our custom [`elara-gfx`](https://github.com/elaraproject/elara-gfx) graphics library for fast, high-quality rendering.

> **Note: Elara UI is incomplete and cannot be used at the moment.** We instead recommend using `iced` for building Rust applications and `PyQt` for building Python applications for Project Elara.
