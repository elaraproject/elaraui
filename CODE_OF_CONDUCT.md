# Code of Conduct

At Project Elara, we believe in treating everyone equally, fairly, and kindly. This includes, but is not limited to, abiding by the following rules:

- Respecting the provisions of the [Project Elara Charter](https://elaraproject.github.io/charter/), in particular, articles 1.1 through 1.6
- Understanding that **you are liable** for the consequences of your actions, regardless of your position
- Choosing to take **intentional steps** to be a cognizant and respectful person, instead of only obeying the rules to avoid consequences

We want to build a welcoming community together, and we ask for your help.
